# Secure Channel Echo Server and Client

The objective of this project was to implement a secure communications channel. Asymmetric encryption, signatures and key management in Java will be utilised to implement a secure protocol.

The project is divided into three sections, with each section built on top of the previous solution. The first section introduces asymmetric encryption, the second introduces key management and finally the third combines the previous two to implement a secure protocol.
